# Mazda Connected Service Relay

Mazda Connected Service API wrapper based on pymazda and Flask.

# Deployment 

Docker can be used to deploy the project locally, simply do `docker-compose up -d`. 

This installs the requirements and launchs the flask server behind a `gunicorn` reverse proxy running on port 5001 in a docker container.

# Usage

Make `POST` calls to `https://mymazda.herokuapp.com/{endpoint}`, where `endpoint` could be something like `startEngine`. To make a valid request, you will need to attach a JSON payload with the following fields:

```json
{
  "username": your_mazda_email,
  "password": your_mazda_password,
  "vid": internal_vehicle_id,
  "region": your_region
}
```

 - `vid`: To obtain the `vid` for your vehicle, you can first make a `POST` call to `https://mymazda.herokuapp.com/vehicles` with just the `username` and `password` as the JSON payload. After getting a list of vehicles, find `id` associated with it. It will be the `vid` of your future API requests.
 - `region`: If you are living in the US, you can omit this field or fill in `MNAO`. Otherwise, it should be `MME` for EU, and `MJO` for Japan.

Below are some examples of API usage. To see a full list of API endpoints, see `app.py`. 

## Example: Start / Stop Engine

`POST` the above JSON to `https://mymazda.herokuapp.com/startEngine` or `https://mymazda.herokuapp.com/stopEngine` to start / stop the engine.

## Example: Send navigation destination to infortainment

Send the following JSON to `https://mymazda.herokuapp.com/sendPOI`. Note that you need the navigation SD card for it to work.

```json
{
  "username": your_mazda_email,
  "password": your_mazda_password,
  "vid": internal_vehicle_id,
  "longitude": longitude_float,
  "latitude": latitude_float,
  "name": name
}
```
